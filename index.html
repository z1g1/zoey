          <h4>Research Experience</h4>
            <dl>
              
              <dt>2009-2011</dt>
              <dd>Neonatal Hemangiomatosis: I performed a review of the literature about neonatal hemangiomatosis. The goal of this project was to determine if previous reports of patient with "neonatal hemangiomatosis" were truly manifestations of this disease or if these cases can be more precisely indentified using current terminology. By analyzing previous cases, we hope to reclassify current and future patients with multifocal vascular lesions. The manuscript was accepted to the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology in December, 2011 under the title "Diffuse Neonatal Hemangiomatosis": an evidence based review of case reports in the literature.  This project was under the direction of Dr. Ilona Frieden, University of California, San Francisco, Director of Pediatric Dermatology, Dr. Beth Drolet, Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, Director of Pediatric Dermatology, Dr. Maria Garzon, Director, Division of Pediatric Dermatology Columbia University and Dr. Thaddeus Mully, University of California, San Francisco, Associate Professor of Pathology.</dd>
              
              <dt>2008-2009</dt>
              <dd>Nevus Simplex: I participated in a pediatric dermatology research project conducted by the University of California, San Francisco and the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin. I analyzed twelve cases of nevus simplex seen by the Pediatric Dermatology Department at University of California, San Francisco during the past five years and researched background information about nevus simplex. This research was accepted for publication in the "Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology" under the title, Nevus Simplex: A reconsideration of nomenclature, sites of involvement, and disease associations. The findings were also presented at the 2009 Meeting of the Society for Pediatric Dermatology. This project was under the direction of Dr. Ilona Frieden, University of California, San Francisco, Director of Pediatric Dermatology, Dr. Beth Drolet, Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, Director of Pediatric Dermatology and Dr. Anna Juern, Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, Pediatric Dermatology Research Fellow.</dd>
              
              <dt>2007-2008</dt>
              <dd>Allergic Contact Dermatitis to Cigarettes: I performed an in-depth literature search on components in cigarettes as potential sources of allergic contact dermatitis, with an emphasis on cocoa, menthol, licorice, colophony, and formaldehyde. This research was published in "Dermatitis" in January, 2009 under the title, Allergic Contact Dermatitis to Cigarettes. The project was also presented by Dr. Alison Ehrlich at the Annual Meeting of the American Contact Dermatitis Society in March, 2009. Advised by Dr. Alison Ehrlich, The George Washington University, Department of Dermatology.</dd>
              
              <dt>2007-2008</dt>
              <dd>Success of Teledermatology in Diagnosis and Treatment of Non-Neoplastic Dermatoses in a Veteran's Administration Population: This research project examined the weekly teledermatology clinic at the DC VA Medical Center, in order to determine whether non-neoplastic dermatoses or tumors were more successfully diagnosed using teledermatology. This research was advised by Dr. George Cohen, DC VA Medical Center, Chief of Dermatology.</dd>
